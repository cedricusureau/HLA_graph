## Introduction

__HLA Graph__ is a tool dedicated to biologist working on anti-HLA antibodies assay. 

Based on retrospective analysis of __thousands of samples__ from Luminex™ LABScreen™ single-antigen assays, we designed networks, also called __graphs__, 
providing an updated overview of class I and II HLA antigens cross-reactivity. 

[In these graphs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedricusureau/HLA_graph/master/figures/b15_exemple.png), each node correspond to an allele and each link correspond to a strong MFI correlation between two alleles. Therefore, two linked nodes often present close MFI values in a large amount of test. 

In our work, we showed that **strong MFI correlation** between different antigens reflect **epitopic similarity**, and we assumed that drawing graphs is a good way to display cross-reactivity interaction.

## HLA Graph Workflow

Based on this model, we have implemented HLA Graph, a data visualization tool. Once user as uploaded datatable containing MFI values from SA1 or SA2 assay, HLA Graph workflow is following these steps :
   - Extract positive antigens toward given MFI Thresholds.
   - From empty graphs templates, highlight with shade of red the positive beads (proportional to MFI). Graphs templates for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, -DQA1, -DPB1 and -DPA1 are present in supplemental data.
   - Highlight in red the links between positive beads that are usually correlated.
   - From the eplets sequences provided by HLA Matchmaker, identify potentially immunoreactive eplet following specific rules.

## Positive eplet algorithm

Rules that identify an eplet to be potentially immuno-reactive are the following : 
   - Not reactive : Eplet carried by one or more of the negative beads.     
   - Probably reactive (displayed in red) : eplets carried by all of the positive beads.
   - Potentially reactive (displayed in green) : eplets carried by one or several positive beads. 

Immuno-reactive eplets carried by tested bead could be shared by many antigens which are not included in the Luminex™ LABScreen™ assay. In order to easily check which protein could be targeted by sample antibodies, a colored datatable is generated by __HLA Graph__. This table summarize the whole protein list corresponding to every positive eplets :

## Input Format 

HLA Graph take as an input an **excel file** with specific shape. In order to use HLA Graph, you must **copy/paste** the MFI values of a sample into this excel file. 
You could find templates of these files here : [SA1](https://github.com/cedricusureau/HLA_graph/blob/master/templates/template_SA1.xls) & [SA2](https://github.com/cedricusureau/HLA_graph/blob/master/templates/template_SA2.xls)

Another way to understand input files shape is to download examples, directly from the websites. Once acquired, you can modify these files by overwriting the MFI values from a new sample :

</p>

<aside class="notice">
    HLA Graph use the most common kit of Luminex Assay. However, you should check if your laboratory uses the same alleles. If you change any allele name in the input file, the raw could be not considered by HLA Graph.

## Launch Analysis

Once your input file is ready, you can use HLA graph following this simple steps : 

   - Select your input file.
   - Select MFI threshold. Lower MFIs are considered negative. You could not change this threshold once the graph are generated. 
   - Launch Analysis.

## Graph Analysis 

Several kind of informations are displayed on graphs :
 
   1 - **Positive nodes** are colored in red. Link between two positives nodes are displayed in red too. **Positive eplets** shared by positives alleles are displayed in **red** (*probably reactive eplets*) or **green** (*potentially reactive eplets*)
   
   2 - Blue nodes correspond to MFI value upper than 1000 but lower than given threshold. they indicate to the user that some beads may become positive by decreasing the threshold, thus revealing new positive eplets. 
   
   3 - For DQ or DP Graph, indicates the sub-unit carrying positive eplets.

# Installation 

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/cedricusureau/HLA_graph.git
cd HLA_graph
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage 


### Activate environment:
```shell script
conda activate HLA_graph
```

### Run server:
```shell script
python server.py
```
Once running, open a web browser and go to `localhost:5000`

### Run in CLI:

Place any number of input file in `/data/sample_example/SA1` or `/data/sample_example/SA2`. Then run :

```shell script
python -m src.hla_main
```
Output files are generated in `result` folder.
You could change the MFI's treshold with `-c` argument (default: 1000).

```shell script
python -m src.hla_main.py -c 2000
```
