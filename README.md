# HLA graph

__HLA Graph__ is a tool dedicated to biologist working on anti-HLA antibodies assay. 

Based on retrospective analysis of __thousands of samples__ from Luminex™ LABScreen™ single-antigen assays, we designed networks, also called __graphs__, 
providing an updated overview of class I and II HLA antigens cross-reactivity. 

[In these graphs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedricusureau/HLA_graph/master/figures/b15_exemple.png), each node correspond to an allele and each link correspond to a strong MFI correlation between two alleles. 

We showed that strong MFI correlation between different antigens reflect epitopic similarity (see figure below), and we assumed that drawing graphs is a good way to display cross-reactivity interaction.

Based on this model, we have implemented HLA Graph, a data visualization tool. Once user as uploaded datatable containing MFI values from SA1 or SA2 assay, HLA Graph workflow is following these steps :
   - Extract positive antigens toward given MFI Thresholds.
   - From empty graphs templates, highlight with shade of red the positive beads (proportional to MFI). Graphs templates for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, -DQA1, -DPB1 and -DPA1 are present in supplemental data.
   - Highlight in red the links between positive beads that are usually correlated.
   - From the eplets sequences provided by HLA Matchmaker, identify potentially immunoreactive eplet following specific rules.

</p>

Rules that identify an eplet to be potentially immuno-reactive are the following : 
   - Not reactive : Eplet carried by one or more of the negative beads.     
   - Probably reactive (displayed in red) : eplets carried by all of the positive beads.
   - Potentially reactive (displayed in green) : eplets carried by one or several positive beads. 

Immuno-reactive eplets carried by tested bead could be shared by many antigens which are not included in the Luminex™ LABScreen™ assay. In order to easily check which protein could be targeted by sample antibodies, a colored datatable is generated by __HLA Graph__. This table summarize the whole protein list corresponding to every positive eplets :

## Installation 

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/cedricusureau/HLA_graph.git
cd HLA_graph
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage 


### Activate environment:
```shell script
conda activate HLA_graph
```

### Run server:
```shell script
python server.py
```
Once running, open a web browser and go to `localhost:5000`

### Run in CLI:

Place any number of input file in `/data/sample_example/SA1` or `/data/sample_example/SA2`. Then run :

```shell script
python -m src.hla_main
```
Output files are generated in `result` folder.
You could change the MFI's treshold with `-c` argument (default: 1000).

```shell script
python -m src.hla_main.py -c 2000
```
